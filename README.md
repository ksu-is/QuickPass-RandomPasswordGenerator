# QuickPass

Through this Python code, users are able to create strong and random passwords in the matter of seconds!

We have all been there before when making a new account or changing a password due to a breach and how hard it can be to come up with one on the spot. With QuickPass the stress of making up hacker proof passwords is no more! This program will allow you to input specifically how you want your password to come out by asking how many characters long you want it to be and if you want to mix letters, numbers, or punctuation. Also if you are looking to create multiple passwords at once, there will be an option to receive more than one at a time.
