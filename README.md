# QuickPass

Through this Python code, users are able to create strong and random passwords in the matter of seconds!

We have all been there before when making a new account and how hard it can be to come up with a password on the spot. With QuickPass the stress of making up multiple passwords is no more! The program will allow you to input specifically how you want your password to come out by asking how many characters long you want it to be and if you want to mix letters, numbers, or specials characters.
